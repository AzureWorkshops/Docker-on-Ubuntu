This is a short workshop to introduce you to Linux-based containers.  In this workshop, you will gain experience in installing and configuring Docker on an Ubuntu server.  You'll then deploy a couple of different images as containers to the server and experiment with managing those images and containers.  Finally, you will configure Azure to allow you to access those containers from outside of your virtual network.
